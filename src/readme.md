# factorization.cpp #

### About ###

This file contains what will become the factorization module for the Fluffy
Forager program. Currently, only the prime factorization functions have been
added to the C++ version.

### Program Usage ###

The program accepts a single long and lists the prime factors along with their
multiplicities.

Try these numbers:

* 36
* 210
* 4352364623462346 (it works!)
