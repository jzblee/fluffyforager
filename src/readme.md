# factorization.cpp #

### About ###

This file contains what will become the factorization module for the Fluffy
Forager program. Currently, only the prime factorization functions have been
added to the C++ version.

### Program Usage ###

The program accepts a single long and lists the prime factors along with their
multiplicities. Afterwards, the complete list of divisors is generated.

Since "factor" and "divisor" are equal in definition, I'll be using the terms
"prime factor" (referring to just the prime factors) and "divisor" (referring to
all factors) to avoid confusion between the two.

Try these numbers:

* 36
* 210
* 4352364623462346 (it works!)
