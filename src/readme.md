# FluffyForager v5 (C++ version) #

### Usage ###

Launch the program in a terminal or command prompt and follow the onscreen instructions. The program will search for valid triples depending on your given range of numbers and options.

### factorization.cpp ###

This file contains the factorization module for the Fluffy Forager program. It finds the prime factors of a number and uses it to generate a list of all of its divisors.

### NOTE ###

This program is still really slow. I am working on optimizing it so that its speed is on par with v4 (in Java) or better.
