### About ###

This file contains the factorization module for the Fluffy Forager program. As of now, only this module has been completed for the C++ version.

### Program Usage ###

The program accepts a single long and lists the prime factors along with their multiplicities. Afterwards, the complete list of divisors is generated.

Since "factor" and "divisor" are equal in definition, I'll be using the terms "prime factor" (referring to just the prime factors) and "divisor" (referring to all factors) to avoid confusion between the two.

Try these numbers:

* 36
* 210
* 4352364623462346 (it works!)
